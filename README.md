Giftastic Api App

Object: To use the giphy API.

I created a giphy app for comfort foods.  10 topics should display upon page load.

The user should be able to search for their own comfort food, the app should add a new button for the user's search and when the new button is clicked, gifs should load to match the users search.

The app is being maintained by Tahnee Hall.
